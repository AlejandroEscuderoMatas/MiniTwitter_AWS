# MiniTwitter_AWS
I developed and managed a version of a social network Twitter-styled, working on both the frontend and backend in the AWS cloud.
I implemented AWS Lambda functions for data validation and request processing and used the AWS S3 storage bucket to efficiently store and deliver media files on the frontend.
I configured EC2 instances as RDS hosts to manage the database on the backend.
